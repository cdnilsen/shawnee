#(Text #114, notebook 14) (From handwritten copy)#


Ŝ ninaanootawaaki sehkamika pasitoozaki yaayaacimooki 
Ĝ I always tell it from them | long ago | old men | they talk about it 
Ê 
Ŝ ye-haatotamowaaci yooma tah-lenaweewiwaaci yeesipeelekomacilotaki kohkomhzena meemehteelemiweeta 
Ĝ what they say | this | where they live | once upon a time when she destroyed it | our grandmother | creator
Ê 
Ŝ hiina toke kohkomhzena yeh-macilotaki peeleko sehkamika yehlekhwaki 
Ĝ that | perhaps | our grandmother | when she destroyed it | once | long ago | time of flood
Ê 
Ŝ hoowe hiine kotakahli lenaweeli maatasi hopakzenaali yeelaakoomaci
Ĝ now | then | another | Indian | here | she let him loose, put him here | her relations
Ê 
Ŝ hoszemeezali ye-haayaatotamowaaci peepiyecihiki sehkamika nohki wahiki cihzena yaawaki
Ĝ her grandchild | how they talked about it | the way it's been | long ago | again | how it will be in fut. | finally | what they say
Ê 
Ŝ nohki wiyehike wiyehsinake lenawe wehzakte yooma tah-lenaweewiyakwe yaawaki
Ĝ again | if anything happens | Indian | he will burn up | this | where we live | what they say
Ê 
Ŝ howeenoki yaasikiisekiki yeesikahkiteeki paasikeela naanemi nyaasinaakwatwi yaalaatotamowaaci sehkamika
Ĝ now | again | then way the day passes | as dry as it is | seems like | pretty near | it looks | what they say | long ago
Ê 
Ŝ pasizootaki nohki mekipwehziizaki ye-hiyaacimowaaci sapkahi
Ĝ old men | also | old women | when they talk about it | of course
Ê 
Ŝ hinoki yaasi-nepoozoyakwe nohki yeesinaakwki caakiwiyehi nepote payeekwa keewakiteepi
Ĝ now | the way we are burnt | dying | also the way it looks | everything | it's dying, suffering[?] | but | still enough
Ê 
Ŝ naaniipenwi ktikaana yeh-tooteeletamowoozowaaci
Ĝ it matures | crops | what is created for them
Ê 
Ŝ yeesimehteeletamaakoci lenawe wa-mhzeeletaki caakiwiyehi
Ĝ what she creates for him | Indian | thing he makes use of | everything
Ê  
Ŝ teepi naaniikinwi maayaalekhi hini keela howecilepwaawe
Ĝ enough | it matures | some parts | that | ... | thankfulness
Ê 
Ŝ yekcitaweeletaki yehtooteeletamawoozoci wahsi-pwaa-skaalaweeci
Ĝ thing he looks after | thing that is created for him | so that he is not hungry
Ê 
Ŝ ksake hotahkweelemekooli hohkomhzali meemehteelemekoci
Ĝ because | she loves him | his grandmother | one by whom he is created
Ê 
Ŝ hiina hosilawe hoszehzima hosilawaalaali mehteelemekoci
Ĝ that | he bows | her grandchild | he bows to her | when he is created by her
Ê 
Ŝ yeesikcitaweelemekoci hohkomhzali lenawe 
Ĝ the way it has been looked after, taken care of by him | his grandmother | Indian
Ê 
Ŝ ‘niyaawe’ hiwa kohkomhzena nohki lenawe
Ĝ thanks | she says | our grandmother | also | Indian (says thanks)

#Marginal note to 39: (i.e. Indian thanks her for creating him & things in first place; she thanks him for taking care of it)#
