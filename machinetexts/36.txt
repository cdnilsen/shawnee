Ŝ Nekotweelena wiyehi niisahaatota.
Ĝ once | something | I talk about it
Ê I will talk about something that happened once.

Ŝ Yaama kimekinhhweemena psekzi.
Ĝ this | our (excl.) animal | deer
Ê This deer was our animal. 

Ŝ Sehkamika pasitoozaki hotaalwi-nhzaawaali psekziili.
Ĝ long ago | old men | they cannot kill him | deer (obv.)  
Ê Long ago old men couldn’t kill deer. 

Ŝ Weeci haalwi-nhzaawaaci hiini zapa hopoonaali yaama mekinhhwe nili siikonali.
Ĝ thus (?) | they cannot kill him | that | supposedly | he possesses him | this | animal | that (obv.) | stone (obv.) 
Ê That’s the reason, supposedly, why they can’t kill him: this animal possesses that stone.

Ŝ Waaci-kiikehekowaaci wiyeezaki yeh-zakipokoci weeweepeziilici wihsiili hiina siikona nisi poonoozo tah-zakipokoci wihsiili.
Ĝ in order that he (obv.) cures him | sombody (pl.) | when he (obv.) bites him | rabid (obv.) | dog (obv.) | that | stone | it is placed | where he (obv.) bites him | dog (obv.)
Ê In order that people can be cured when bitten by a mad dog, that stone is placed on the place where the dog has bitten.  

Ŝ Howe na hocaakiyotahpata hiini pa-hoci-pwa[a]-weepezici wiyeeza keekisiweelemekoci.
Ĝ then | that | he sucks out all of it | that | why he does not go mad | somebody | he who he (obv.) likes
Ê Then it sucks out everything: that’s the reason why anyone who is liked (by the stone) does not go mad.

Ŝ Hina siikona mata waalaci hapiwa.
Ĝ that | stone | not | often | he exists
Ê That stone is not often available.

¶
Ŝ Weeci-waakotama hini niila peeleko nizakipokwa weeweepezita wihsi.
Ĝ thus | I know him | that | I | only (?) | he (obv.) bites me | he who is rabid | dog
Ê The reason I know that is because I myself long ago was bitten by a mad dog.

Ŝ Hiina hawoozo siikona yeh-naatawhhoozooya.
Ĝ that | he is used | stone | when I am doctored
Ê That stone was used when I was doctored.

Ŝ Nikiikehekwa hina siikona.
Ĝ he cures me | that | stone
Ê I was cured by that stone.

Ŝ Weski yeh-sipoonoozoci nhzena pesikwi zakasksinwa.
Ĝ still | when he is put on, applied | three times | by itself, alone | he sticks on 
Ê When it was first applied, it stuck on by itself three times.

Ŝ Paalohi toke hohkwaawiwiiyaaki howe penhsinwa.
Ĝ finally | possibly | he is full (??) | then | he falls (off)
Ê Then, finally, perhaps because it was full, it fell off.

Ŝ Honohki hozepilotawoozo mata payeekwa hini laakwasi zakasksinwa.
Ĝ again | he is cleaned off | not | but | that | time | he sticks on 
Ê It was cleaned off again but that time it did not stay stuck. 

Ŝ Nohki yeh-penhsiki mata kiteeni wiisa-zakasksinwa we toke ksake hocaakata hina meemacaaziki mskwi. 
Ĝ again | when it falls off | not | again | he would stick on | then | possibly | because | that | he eats all of it | that | that which is bad | blood
Ê When it fell off again, (we concluded) that it wasn’t going to stick on again, perhaps because it ate up all the bad blood.

Ŝ We nikiike. Mata (?) wesilaasamamekwatwi yeh-zakipokoci weeweepezilici wihsiili.
Ĝ then | I recover | not | it feels good | where he (obv.) bites me | rabid (obv.) | dog (obv.) 
Ê Then I recovered. (The part of my body) which was bitten by the mad dog felt good. 

Ŝ Yaska [h]inoki nikwzaaki wihsiiki.
Ĝ still | now | I fear them | dogs
Ê Even now I’m still afraid of dogs.
